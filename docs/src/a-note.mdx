# A Note on Transpilation

Unlike Porth, the stack exists only at compile time. When the compiler emits
C code, all values are stored in variables. (Ironically, these values still live
on a stack. But the C code uses a *call* stack.) To see how this works, consider
the following program:

```hop
fn func {
    true    // stack is [bool]
    1       // stack is [bool, int]
    false   // stack is [bool, int, bool]
    putln   // stack is [bool, int]
    put     // stack is [bool]
    true    // stack is [bool, bool]
    ~ ~     // stack is []
}
```

The compiler keeps track of the *maximum* number of values of each type on the
stack at any time. In this case, we have a maximum of 2 `bool`s and 1 `int`. So
the C code looks like this:

```C
void func() {
    bool bool1, bool2;
    int int1;

    bool1 = true;
    int1 = 1;
    bool2 = false;
    putln(bool2);
    put(int2);
    bool2 = true;
}
```

As you can see, the compiler allocates enough variables to hold all the stack
values. Each time we push a value onto the stack, the compiler stores it in one
of the variables. We we push `true` in the first like of the function `func`,
it gets stored in the variable `bool1`. When we push `1`, it gets stored in
the variable `int1`. When we push `false`, the variable `bool1` is already in use,
so the values get stored in the variable `bool2`.

When generating C code, the compiler keeps track of a *variable* stack instead
of a *type* stack. The variable stack looks like this:

```hop
fn func {
    true    // stack is [bool1]
    1       // stack is [bool1, int1]
    false   // stack is [bool1, int1, bool2]
    putln   // stack is [bool1, int1]
    put     // stack is [bool1]
    true    // stack is [bool1, bool2]
    ~ ~     // stack is []
}
```

When a function is called (let's use `putln` as an example), the compiler looks
at the stack and determines which variable to pass into the function. Before
the `putln` call, the variable stack is `[bool1, int1, bool2]`. The compiler
looks at the top of the stack and passes the variable `bool2` into the function
`putln`.
